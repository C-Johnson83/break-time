# Break Clock ⏰

## Introduction  
Welcome to Break Clock, the app designed to help our genius coding instructor (who's not exactly known for their timekeeping skills) calculate when our breaks are over.  

In the fast-paced world of coding, taking breaks is essential for maintaining productivity and preventing burnout.  

However, for our brilliant coding instructor, keeping track of time during breaks can be as challenging as debugging a complex algorithm.  

With Break Clock, you'll always know when it's time to get back to the code grind!

## Features
- **Break Time Setter**: Set the end time for your break with just a click of a button. Break Clock takes care of the timekeeping so you can focus on recharging your coding batteries, emptying your bladder, and getting some snacks.  

- **Gentle Reminder**: When break time is over, Break Clock won't rudely interrupt your relaxation. Instead, it delivers a subtle fash of the screen to nudge you back into productivity mode, like a friendly tap on the shoulder.

## How to Use
1. Click the "When is Break Over" button to see the end time for your break. No need to worry about time zone conversions or complex calculations—Break Clock has you covered!  

2. Enjoy your break knowing that Break Clock is silently counting down the seconds for you.  

3. When break time is up, a subtle screen flash will remind you to wrap up the leisure and return to your coding adventures. It's like having a personal timekeeper, minus the stern looks.
